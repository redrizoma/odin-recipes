    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h4>Serves 4</h4>
    <p>
      Deep-poach all of the shellfish, one cariety at a time, in a pot of salted
      water. If using shrimp or lobster, cook those first, as they will flaver
      the water for the remaining seafood. Cook until each is barely done, then
      remove and allow to cool. Once all of the seafood has been cooked, remove
      the meats from the shells and cut into bite-size pieces. Reserve the
      seafood and 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rub the sides of a bowl with the garlic and ginger to aromatize it and
      discard. Add the lime juice, vinegar, chipotle, until it is well mixed
      with the liquid. Let sit fot 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add the reserved seafood, onion, and celery and toss to combine.
      Refrigerate for at least 20 minutes and up to 2 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before serving, add the sherry and cilantro and toss well. Divide
      among individual servings dishes and garnish with boiled sweet potato
      slices and radicchio.
